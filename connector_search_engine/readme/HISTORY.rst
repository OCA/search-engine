16.0.0.1.4 (2023-11-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Fix error when calling the methods *export_record* or *delete_record* from
  the *se.binding* model when called on a recordset with items from different
  *se.backend*.

  The *export* and *delete* methods involves the use of a *Backend Adapter* to
  communicate with the target search engine. We then need to process the bindings
  by backend to call the correct adapter and ensure at same time a batch process
  of the requested operation for all the records linked to the same backend. (`#173 <https://github.com/OCA/search-engine/issues/173>`_)


16.0.0.1.2 (2023-11-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Add missing description on the "se.binding.state.updater" model. As well as
  ensuring consistency in the model definition, this change removes a
  warning message from the server logs at registry load time.

  Prevent warning message in server logs when running tests. (`#172 <https://github.com/OCA/search-engine/issues/172>`_)


16.0.0.1.1 (2023-10-13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bugfixes**

- Fixes cache issue with the *se_binding_ids* field on the *s.indexable.record*
  model. When a binding is created or updated or deleted, the cache for the
  *se_binding_ids* field for referenced records is now invalidated. That way,
  the next time the field is accessed after such an operation, the value is
  recomputed to reflect the change. (`#163 <https://github.com/OCA/search-engine/issues/163>`_)


16.0.0.1.0 (2023-10-13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Features**

- A new action **Update state** is now available on *Search Engine Record* objects.
  This action allows you to update the state of selected records on the tree view.

  Add a smart button to quickly access to the bound records from the
  *Search Engine Backend* and *Search Engine Record* views. (`#162 <https://github.com/OCA/search-engine/issues/162>`__)


**Bugfixes**

- Fix Search Engine Binding form view. The fields data and error are now
  properly displayed and fit the width of the form.

  Makes the Odoo's admin user a member of the *Search Engine Connector Manager* group. (`#162 <https://github.com/OCA/search-engine/issues/162>`__)
