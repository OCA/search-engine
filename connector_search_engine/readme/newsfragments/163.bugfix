Fixes cache issue with the *se_binding_ids* field on the *s.indexable.record*
model. When a binding is created or updated or deleted, the cache for the
*se_binding_ids* field for referenced records is now invalidated. That way,
the next time the field is accessed after such an operation, the value is
recomputed to reflect the change.
