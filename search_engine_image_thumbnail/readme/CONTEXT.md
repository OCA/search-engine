When you export images to an index, you may want to ensure that the images are exported
in a format and size that is suitable for the application that will consume the index.

This module depends on the
[fs_image_thumdbnail](https://github.com/oca/storage/tree/16.0/fs_image_thumbnail)
module. This last one provides a method and a mixin used to generate thumbnails from a
`FSImageValue` object.
